<p>I am an associate professor of statistical science and computer science at Duke University. 
	I work primarily on fundamental properties of different statistical concepts 
	with broad inetrests in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods. 
	I am the Co-Director two labs at Duke: (1) The <a href="https://www.polarizationlab.com/">Polarization Lab at Duke</a> 
	brings together scholars from the social sciences, statistics, and computer science to develop new technology to bridge Americaâ€™s partisan divide. 
	(2) The <a href="https://almostmatchingexactly.github.io/">Almost Matching Exactly Lab at Duke</a> brings together statisticians, computer scientists, economists
	and political scientists to develop tools for interpretable causal inference.</p>
	
	<p> I am the past president of the <a href="http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/">New Researchers Group</a> at the 
		<a href="http://www.imstat.org/">Institute of Mathematical Statistics</a> which coordinates the 
	Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability (supported by the 
		National Science Foundation).</p>
	
	<p> If interested in joining our group to work on exciting problems in statistical methodology for
		political polarization, network analysis and large scale causal inference, please reach out via email 
		with your CV. </p>
	
	<p> Travel is a bit on hiatus. Should resume in September-ish 2023. </p>
	
	<p> Our work is graciously supported by NIH, NSF, ARI, Facebook, Google, the Templeton Foundation and Duke University. </p>
