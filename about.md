I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistical Science and the Co-Director of the Polarization Lab and the Almost Matching Exactly Lab at Duke. I joined the department after finishing a NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Statistics Department at Harvard University. Prior to that I completed my PhD in statistics at the University of Washington in Seattle and a joint Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Chicago. My research concentrates on developing theory and methodological tools for computational social science applications, with particular interests in high dimensional data, causal inference and network analysis. With collaborators at Duke we have developed novel tools for community detection, for extracting causal signals from high dimensional observational data and for new approaches to implementing and analyzing network experiments.
